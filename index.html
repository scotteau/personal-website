        <div class="interactive">
          <p>🎉Excellent! Time to know a bit about me.</p>

          <p>
            Knowing a new person could be problem sometimes. I will keep it
            short. I was chef 🥘for more than 5 years, Studied Digital Design in
            Curtin University.I had my *own 👨‍🍳restaurant* for 3 years, had my
            highs and lows. 🤔After closing down the restaurant, I decided to
            pursue 👨🏻‍💻software engineering career since it is always something I
            wanted to do while in uni.
          </p>
          <p>
            I drove 🕶🚙Uber while teach myself web development, it is an
            interesting phase of my life, because the job was very flexible and
            offered such unique social experience, i.e. meeting so many
            different people all with different narratives. On the other hand, I
            was picking up the web dev knowledge rather quickly as I had some
            foundation built in uni but the technology moved fast since I
            graduated, there are so many things to learn. It is 😱scary and
            🤓exciting at the same time.
          </p>
          <p>
            Anyway, back to me, I always consider myself as a 🤔pragmatic solver
            and very 😝authentic person. I take 💯responsibility of my life, and
            examine myself constantly and vigorously to eliminate any false
            thinking. After couple months of part-time study, I found myself
            struggling with how to write the production level code, and confused
            of which tech path to take. That's when I realised I must find
            guidance to navigate this technology career path, like fresh young
            chefs were told in the kitchen, "Don't be afraid to ask for help".
          </p>
          <p>
            I enrolled in a Sydney-based ⌨️*coding boot camp* couple months
            later. I planned everything and was ready to be away for solid 3
            months to really sharpen myself. The Covid-19 😷pandemic happened.
            Two days before my ✈️ flight to Sydney, the infested cases have been
            doubled since I last checked couple of days ago. "It is definitely
            getting worse" I thought. Now I have some decision to make, I don't
            think I should go to Sydney. But everything was organised and
            planned, it is a bit hard to walk away but it was the right decision
            to ignore the 🌊sunken cost and stay home. Two weeks later, the
            cases grew 20 folds, and all travel was ✋banned🙀.
          </p>

          <p>
            😂Lucky for me, the school did offer online teaching. It is not
            something I had expected and I could not foresee any of this, but it
            is often crucial in life to find the serenity to accept the things
            cannot be changed, the courage to change the things that can and the
            wisdom to tell the difference. This kind of becomes my motto for
            life.
          </p>

          <p>
            I was teaching myself Angular before, it had this so-called "steep
            learning curve". However , it did provide me exposure to so many
            technical topics and showed me the some of the best practices that
            improve my skills as a web developer.
          </p>

          <p>
            The boot camp was really good too, we went through the basics, and I
            picked up React & Node.js along the way. Though I missed out on some
            of the social experience of a coding boot camp, It did offered me
            the chance the consolidate my learning, and helped me to obtain a
            deeper understanding of the craft of modern web development. It is
            also worth to mention, the most immense learning for me was to gain
            the firsthand experiences of how to work as a team on several real
            software projects. Prior to the school, I can't possible learn any
            of this since you can't really call yourself a team if you are the
            only player. I really believe this made me ready for the real deal,
            I will be fit right in on any software teams.😎
          </p>
          <p>
            So yeah, here is my story. What are your takeaways? I hope they are
            good.😝
